"Coronavirus has now contributed to the deaths of one million people worldwide. The report of the millionth death arrived just short of 10 months after the first confirmed death, in China in January. The virus continues its spread across the world, with more than 33 million confirmed cases in 188 countries. The virus is surging in many regions and some countries that had apparent success in suppressing initial outbreaks are also seeing infections rise again. In the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 5,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date",Real,1
"The government's 10pm mandatory closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants in England has come under scrutiny, following videos posted on social media of crowds gathering outside venues in some cities after closing time. Ministers have been defending the policy but the mayor of Greater Manchester has called for an ""urgent review of the emerging evidence"" of its impact. So, why was it brought in and what is the science behind it? Why do the new measures target pubs, bars and restaurants? The government introduced the 10pm closing time following a spike in cases across England. Other measures include mandatory table service and the use of face masks whenever a customer is not at their table (for example, when they go to the toilet). Owners can also be fined up to £10,000 for failing to implement rules. Indoor venues, including bars and restaurants, have long been considered particularly vulnerable to the spreading of the virus. ""Wherever you get people crowded together, for example concert halls, cruise ships, house parties, bars and pubs, you risk spreading a virus,"" says Dr Julian Tang, a professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester.",Real,1
"One patient and five members of staff at a cardiology ward in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital have tested positive for Covid-19, the BBC can reveal. The Belfast Health and Social Care Trust confirmed the outbreak. It is understood the staff received the positive test results over the past fortnight and testing is ""ongoing"". The Trust also said one patient was self-isolating but that no one was currently off work as a result of the cluster. Last week the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride wrote to all healthcare staff advising them how to minimise the risk of coronavirus outbreaks in hospitals and elsewhere. He wrote: ""It is extremely challenging to maintain our guard at all times and this may inadvertently result in lapses in maintaining the recommended precautions in social interactions and other settings across our health and care facilities. ""It is therefore particularly important that we all remain vigilant in areas such as changing rooms, staff rooms, dining rooms and as they engage in conversations or interact in corridors and other settings when they are not engaged in direct patient facing activities.""",Real,1
"Four councils in north Wales are to go into local lockdown in a bid to tackle the spread of Covid-19. People will not be able to leave or enter Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, and Wrexham unless they have a ""reasonable excuse"" such as work or education. They are the same restrictions as seen in most of south Wales, where lockdowns cover 11 different areas. The new measures will come into effect at 18:00 BST on Thursday. It will be illegal to meet others indoors who are not within your immediate household. Vaughan Gething, Wales' health minister, said a similar pattern of transmission had been seen in the four areas as there had been in the south. Rates in neighbouring Gwynedd and Anglesey currently ""remain low"", Mr Gething said, making the announcement in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday evening. Tuesday's announcement means 504,956 more people will be added to local lockdowns, with a total of 2.3 million people under tougher restrictions than at the start of September.",Real,1
"Visits to a prison have been stopped after an outbreak there caused a ""surge"" in Covid-19 cases in the area. There have been 53 cases confirmed at HMP Lowdham Grange in Nottinghamshire's Newark and Sherwood district. The number of Covid-19 cases in the area is higher than the current national average and the county's public health director said the jail's cases accounted for the ""surge"". The prison director said the ""priority was to keep everyone safe"". Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Jonathan Gribbin, director of public health for Nottinghamshire, said: ""We've been tracking quite carefully what is going on and we've seen quite a rise in cases across the district. ""There's a total of 53 confirmed cases at Lowdham Grange - 40 prisoners and 13 members of staff - which accounts for quite a lot of that surge. ""A number of measures are in place.

"Police officers in England and Wales are to be told they can download the NHS Covid-19 app on to their personal smartphones and use them at work. The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) issued the guidance after carrying out its own technical review of the software. Individual officers and other police staff will be informed on Wednesday. The NPCC had previously advised officers not to download the app on any device, while it reviewed its impact. And they will still be told not to install it on work handsets. These typically have their Bluetooth functionality disabled. And the automated contact-tracing process relies on Bluetooth's wireless signals. An NPCC spokesman told BBC News some personnel involved in covert and special operations as well as other sensitive roles would also be told to consider not installing the app on any phone until further guidance was issued. ""It is important that we have confidence that the NHS app will work for officers and staff consistently across the country,"" he said. ""And it is for this reason that we have recommended that officers and staff download the app to their personal as opposed to their work devices."" NHS Covid-19 was released to the wider public on Thursday, after several changes to an earlier test version. It follows the release of similar software in Scotland and Northern Ireland.",Real,1
"Students at Aberdeen University have been warned that fines could be imposed for coronavirus rule breaches. The university has written to students following reports of guideline breaches in halls of residence at the weekend. There is a warning of ""robust action"", with fines of up to £250. There is also the potential for further action - including suspension or expulsion. Some students said it was a ""disappointing"" stance being taken by the university. NHS Grampian said an investigation was continuing into 62 Covid cases linked to university's student population. It is not currently being treated as a single cluster. The letter to all students, from acting director of operations Debbie Dyker, states: ""I am writing following reports of breaches of national Covid-19 related guidance within private halls this weekend. ""I am disappointed to hear these reports, especially in light of the various communications that have been issued to our community in the last week. ""Given the events of the last few days I want to emphasise that any breaches will not be tolerated, and those found to be breaking the rules will face robust action.""",Real,1
"I feel as if this pandemic has truly left me with nothing job wise, says 19-year old Jack Smith from North East Scotland. ""I know I must sound like I'm playing a small violin for myself, but frankly I have more than enough time on my hands and literally nothing to do."" Jack has always dreamed of running his own events company, planning weddings, parties and conferences. And at the start of the year he'd lined up work experience at a local events firm, as well as with a company in Australia. Then the pandemic hit and that all fell through. He has also been laid off from his part-time job after being on furlough. ""I feel as if I shouldn't be complaining as much people have it a lot worse, losing their jobs that support their families, homes and livelihoods,"" he says. ""But in terms of my personal confidence and mental health, I have truly never felt worse."" Confidence knocked. He is not alone. More than one in three young people say they have lost hope of getting their dream job because of coronavirus, the Prince's Trust has said. The charity said a survey of 2,000 people aged 16 to 25 across the UK showed 44% had lower aspirations for the future as a result of the pandemic. Its UK chief executive, Jonathan Townsend, said the pandemic had eroded young people's confidence. The charity said action was needed to prevent a ""lost generation"". According to the research, carried out by Censuswide, 41% of young people believe their future goals now seem ""impossible to achieve"", with this rising to 50% of those surveyed from poorer backgrounds.",Real,1
"Steve Thomas, leader of the council's Labour group, said the posts sent a ""dangerous"" message after the borough went into local lockdown last week. The World Health Organization has said there is no evidence of a link between 5G and coronavirus. 'Danger'.Mr Holland, ward councillor for Six Bells, said the Facebook posts were his personal views, not the council's. He denied being a ""conspiracy theorist"" and said he stood by his views. Mr Thomas told the Local Democracy Reporting Service the posts were ""deeply, deeply concerning, especially taking into account the huge rise in Blaenau Gwent cases in the past eight days"". ""There is a danger that this information can influence people to put themselves and others at risk,"" he said.

"The World Health Organisation has announced it and leading partners have agreed to a plan to roll out 120 million rapid-diagnostic coronavirus tests to help lower and middle-income countries. It is to make up ground in a testing gap with richer countries. The WHO issued an emergency-use listing last week for the antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests which cost 5 dollars (£3.90) each. The programme initially requires 600 million dollars (£467 million) and is to get started as early as next month to provide better access to areas where it is harder to reach with PCR tests that are often used in wealthier nations. The rapid tests look for antigens, or proteins found on the surface of the virus. They are generally considered less accurate — though much faster — than higher-grade genetic tests, known as PCR tests. PCR tests require processing with specialised lab equipment and chemicals. Typically that turnaround takes several days to deliver results to patients.",Real,1
"More than 10 million people have downloaded the NHS Covid-19 app since it launched on Thursday, the Health Secretary has said. Matt Hancock said on social media it was an “absolutely fantastic” response so far, and urged more people to download it. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that six million people had downloaded the app the first day it launched, and this had since risen to 10 million by midday on Sunday. More than 1.5 million venue check-ins were recorded on Saturday while more than 460,000 businesses have downloaded and printed QR code posters that can be scanned by the app to check-in to premises, it added. These QR codes allow contact tracers to reach multiple people if an outbreak is identified in a venue.",Real,1
"A third wave of coronavirus is “entirely possible”, with lockdowns only deferring the problem, an expert has warned. Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said that while strict measures stop the immediate crisis and quickly reduce transmission, they do not make the virus go away. Speaking on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday he said that modelling had previously shown it was “entirely possible” that a second lockdown would be needed in September. When asked if there could be a third wave of coronavirus he said: “That’s entirely possible. “The scenario I mentioned earlier does actually include this possibility and this is just another demonstration of what I was saying earlier that lockdown doesn’t solve the problem, it defers its.",Real,1
"A major supermarket chain has become the first to introduce limits on certain items amid a rise in demand in response to the tightening of coronavirus restrictions. Morrisons has told ITV News it has introduced a purchase limit of three items on a small range of products - including toilet roll. A Morrisons spokesperson told us  ""We are introducing a limit on a small number of key products, such as toilet roll and disinfectant. Our stock levels of these products are good but we want to ensure that they are available for everyone."" This is the first supermarket to introduce such restrictions as a result of the second wave of Covid infections. The sector is seeking to reassure customers there are no supply issues. A return to scenes of empty shelves and panic buying would be unnecessary according to senior industry sources.",Real,1

"Coronavirus has stifled normal university life and the rule of six makes it difficult for the hundreds of students living together in halls to meet with one another. The pandemic has also had a major impact on teaching and how lectures are carried out in campuses nationwide. Around 1,700 students at Manchester Metropolitan University have been told to self-isolate after 127 of them tested positive for coronavirus. While earlier this week, a Covid-19 outbreak at Glasgow University this week shows just how precarious life is for students and lecturers alike, after more than 100 people tested positive and nearly 600 people are now self-isolating.

"Would-be late-night drinkers in England have faced the first evening of new measures aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus. From Thursday, all pubs, bars and restaurants had to shut by 10pm – meaning time at the bar will be somewhere around 9pm. Many people were not put off a midweek tipple or two by the new restrictions on Thursday, with pub-goers still heading to Soho, central London. A small police presence could be seen on the pedestrianised streets but no problems were reported. The Metropolitan Police said Commissioner Cressida Dick was out on patrol in Shoreditch, a popular nighttime area, with local officers “who were engaging with members of the public, to remind them of their responsibility to keep themselves and others safe to minimise the spread”. The force said it would step up its enforcement of Covid regulations in response to the changes and rising rates of infection in the capital. “Londoners should expect to see police officers engaging with members of the public to remind them of their responsibility to keep themselves and others safe.",Real,1
